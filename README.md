# ML_Siena
Webscraping associated with a little spice of machine learning to find patterns on second-hand car prices.
(on this particular case it was Fiat-Siena)

# First things first
There is a snippet of code used for webscraping purposes collecting announced cars properties as price, kilometers, years, etc.

# Database
As soon as you have enough data collected from any given car model, you can play with some data analysis, I tried to figure out any kind of pattern on the file carros.csv, and got some beautiful polynomial regression.

# Also
Using sklearn it was possible to find the "obvious", using extratrees classifier it was found that the main feature that affects a second-hand car price was the mileage.

All code found here was made for learning purposes, feel free to make use of anything here.
